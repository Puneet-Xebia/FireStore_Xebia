# firestore_poc

A new Flutter project.


## Goal

This application Gives a demo of real time use of FireStore. It's a quiz application where you can perform all the CRUD operations like adding,updating,deleting of questions and answers and can see the real time updation on fireStore and app vice versa. Both app and FireStore are in sync with each other. 

I have used a Firease Console account where I crearted a collection. Where there are questions and answers are added.

## Architecture

Provider and Stream(which are some techniques from BLoC pattern) archtecture has been used in this application.
